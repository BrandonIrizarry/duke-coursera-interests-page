            <b>Hi!</b>
            <p>This page describes my general set of interests. First are listed those pertaining to <em>professional</em> stuff,
                followed by things of a lighter nature.</p>

            <p>Of course, as it arises, being with family and friends brings a fulfillment nothing else can.</p>

            <h2>Favorite Programming Books</h2>
            <p>This somehow popped into my head as being apt for a page such as this. While the list items here are numbered, it's done more for emphasis; there is no actual ranking implied here.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>The C Programming Language, 2nd edition.</h3>
                            <p>Sometimes known as "K&R" according to the
                                authors' last initials. While old, it's a book
                                worthy of the recognition it receives. The
                                writing style is cogent and professional, characterized
                                by an enviable terseness - in a word, fantastic. You wish that
                                every programming language had its own K&R-style book.
                            </p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Programming in Lua, 4th edition.</h3>
                    <p>
                        A no-nonsense, professionally written Lua
                        tutorial by the authors of the language
                        itself. Not so difficult that it would be off-putting
                        for enthusiasts, yet challenging and
                        stimulating enough for you to learn and master
                        a great deal. To go through the second part of
                        the book (the C API), you need to know C.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>The Little Schemer</h3>
                    <p>A deceptively simple but profound book that
                    will tutor you on the proper use of
                    recursion. Overall, one of the most enjoyable
                    pieces of technical material I've ever read.</p>
